  mechanized_equipment_2:0 "1013 Mechanized"
    mechanized_equipment_2_short:0 "1013 Mechanized"
    mechanized_equipment_2_desc:0 "Initial mechanised infantry sections utilised a myriad of designs such as up-armored wheeled trucks or dedicated tracked vehicles meant to protect their occupants from small arms fire. The halftrack design is something of a compromise between tracked and wheeled vehicles, meant to combine the versatility of the former and the speed of the latter. Field experience also influenced these halftracks to offer more means of self-defense, from the inclusion of mounted machineguns to gun ports for the passengers to fire out from."
  mechanized_equipment_3:0 "1016 Mechanized"
    mechanized_equipment_3_short:0 "1016 Mechanized"
    mechanized_equipment_3_desc:0 "A continuation of existing halftrack designs, these advanced halftracks have been improved with new engines and better protection schemes. Though some believe that the halftrack might be a deadend in terms of infantry personnel carriers, we have done everything to make these new halftrack designs to be the pinnacle of this line of thought."
  mechanized_equipment_x:0 "1020 Armored Personnel Carrier"
    mechanized_equipment_x_short:0 "1020 APC"
    mechanized_equipment_x_desc:0 "As engines grow more powerful and infantry protection gets more effective, nations diverge from established mechanised half-track design and specialize in new designs that are either fully tracked or fully wheeled. These armored personnel carriers carry over the protection of earlier mechanised vehicles while improving in speed and capacity."
  motorized_rocket_equipment_2:0 "1020 Motorized Rocket Artillery"
  mechanized_equipment_x_2:0 "1026 Armored Personnel Carrier"
    mechanized_equipment_x_2_short:0 "1026 APC"
    mechanized_equipment_x_2_desc:0 "Continued development of the APC concept has led to new designs with mounted turrets capable of supporting infantry after they have dismounted. While lighter than the weaponry seen on AFVs or armored cars, APCs themselves can now provide fire support."
    # mechanized_equipment_x_2_desc:0 "Significantly different from regular APCs, IFVs are specifically designed to act as a specialised weapons platform intended to provide similar firepower of a heavier combat vehicle. It achieves this with sacrificing some of its passenger capacity and by mounting a turreted heavy weapon, such as a light auto-cannon or a smaller calibre gun. This makes IFVs more suitable for urban combat than tanks, and could possibly revolutionise mechanised warfare."

  # Weapons #
  melee_equipment_0:0 "Medieval Weapons"
    #Unsure if "Medieval" is really applicable as the Middle Ages mayn't have occurred in the EaW timeline, but its probably the best descriptor for pre-industrial melee weaponry (without saying pre-industrial melee weaponry).
    melee_equipment_0_short:0 "Medieval Weapons"

    melee_equipment_1_short:0 "Muzzle-Loaded Gun"
  infantry_equipment_0:0 "Breech-Loaded Rifle"
    infantry_equipment_0_short:0 "Breech-Loaded Rifle"
    infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "Muskets of old have been largely replaced by breech-loaded, rifled firearms. These rifles use smokeless powder and can be reloaded quickly and fired with higher accuracy, increasing our soldiers' effectiveness drastically."
  infantry_equipment_1:0 "Bolt-Action Rifle"
    infantry_equipment_1_short:0 "Bolt-Action Rifle"
    infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "Bolt-action rifles are replacing older breech-loaded designs thanks to improvements in accuracy and fire rate. Additionally, bullet magazines have been developed to decrease reload times and protect bullets while not in use."
  infantry_equipment_2:0 "Submachine Gun"
    infantry_equipment_2_short:0 "Submachine Gun"
    infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "Machine guns proved to be powerful weapons but lack mobility. However, submachine guns allow soldiers to maintain high rates of fire even on the move. Newer designs make these firearms particularly effective in close-quarters combat."
  infantry_equipment_3:0 "Battle Rifle"
    infantry_equipment_3_short:0 "Battle Rifle"

  # Upgrades #
  infantry_weapons2:0 "Ancillary Infantry Weaponry"
    infantry_weapons2_desc:0 "Non-standard sidearms have already been in use within our armed forces. By developing a set of standardized ancillary weapons, we can increase our soldiers' effectiveness drastically. This includes weapons such as pistols, revolvers, and combat knives."
  improved_infantry_weapons_2:0 "Specialized Grenades I"
    improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc:0 "We can introduce specialized grenades capable of unique effects such as exploding on impact, generating a cloud of smoke, or stunning anything in a small range to supplement our standard infantry grenades. Additionally, anti-tank grenades can be deployed to units that lack more robust anti-tank options."
  advanced_infantry_weapons2:0 "Ammunition Improvements I"
    advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc:0 "The latest production techniques and material science innovations have led to new designs for bullet casings, artillery shells, and more. These advancements increase ammunition reliability and reduce the chances of misfiring."
  advanced_infantry_weapons_a:0 "Advanced Landmines"
    advanced_infantry_weapons_a_desc:0 "Ensuring our landmines are built with the least amount of metals possible is paramount in slowing minefield clearing. It is also possible to integrate anti-handling devices to larger anti-tank landmines to disable valuable bomb disposal personnel."
  advanced_infantry_weapons_c:0 "Specialized Grenades II"
    advanced_infantry_weapons_c_desc:0 "Field experience has shown the need to differentiate standard infantry grenades into offensive and defensive types, the former relying on a shorter-range concussive effect to kill while the latter relies upon shrapnel generation. Offensive grenades are used when advancing to avoid collateral damage to neutral or friendly forces. New types of grenades such as the incendiary grenade have also been developed."
  advanced_infantry_weapons_d:0 "Ancillary Weapon Modernisation"
    advanced_infantry_weapons_d_desc:0 "Our rapidly developing weapons program has put the effectiveness of our existing sidearms into question. Modernising our sidearms through extensive modification or through the development of entirely new platforms will improve the combat effectiveness of our soldiers."

  ## SUPPORT WEAPONS ##
  support_weapons:0 "Heavy Infantry Weapons I"
    support_weapons_desc:0 "Heavy machine guns (HMGs) and mortars were developed as intermediaries between infantry small arms and towed artillery systems. They bring the firepower of artillery to the frontline and are capable of keeping up with infantry movements to a limited extent."
  support_weapons2:0 "Specialized Small Arms I"
    support_weapons2_desc:0 "Non-standard weapons such as shotguns and sniper rifles can be adapted for use in specialized combat roles such as close-quarter battles and long-range engagements where our standard infantry weapons may not perform as well."
  support_weapons3:0 "Flamethrowers"
    support_weapons3_desc:0 "Fire has been used as a weapon by dragons for ages. We can put this power into the hands of our soldiers by constructing a specialized flame-throwing weapon that can project a controllable jet of fire. Although highly vulnerable themselves, flamethrowers will become feared on the battlefield just as dragons once were."
  support_weapons4:0 "Heavy Infantry Weapons II"
    support_weapons4_desc:0 "Newer HMGs are designed around air cooling rather than bulky water-cooled systems, and are capable of barrel replacements once a high enough temperature is reached. Improved mortar base plate construction and materials allow for better recoil mitigation and lighter weight."
  support_weapons_a:0 "Specialized Small Arms II"
    support_weapons_a_desc:0 "Additional specialized ammo types for shotguns can provide more options to operators depending on the scenario, such as slug, flechette, and explosive rounds. Developing adjustable, long-range scopes for sniper rifles will give our snipers an advantage in accuracy."
  support_weapons_b:0 "Grenade Launchers"
    support_weapons_b_desc:0 "Previously, rifles acted as makeshift grenade launchers through the use of specialized rifle grenades. By creating a dedicated grenade launcher, we can develop and field new types of grenades that couldn't be used with rifle-launched systems."
  support_weapons_c:0 "High-Power Crystal Rifles"
    support_weapons_c_desc:0 "High-power crystal rifles are experimental magical rifles that are capable of penetrating thick, hard materials such as concrete and steel. This is accomplished by discharging entire crystals with every shot. Although wasteful, and cumbersome to reload, it functions as an anti-everything rifle through sheer firepower alone."
  support_weapons_d:0 "Heavy Infantry Weapons III"
    support_weapons_d_desc:0 "Further development of HMGs has led to the adoption of larger calibers and refined barrel replacement methods, along with improved belt-feeding systems and ammunition containers. Advanced sights and range adjustment systems have been fitted to existing mortars to improve accuracy among gunners."
  support_weapons_e:0 "Specialized Small Arms III"
    support_weapons_e_desc:0 "Semi-automatic shotguns and sniper rifles have been fielded in small numbers to test their efficacy as opposed to traditional pump-action and bolt-action designs. Current evidence shows that a shotgun capable of switching between semi-automatic and pump-action will be necessary as certain types of ammunition lack the power to cycle in semi-automatic mode."
  support_weapons_f:0 "Molten Crystal Projectors"
    support_weapons_f_desc:0 "A flamethrower variant, molten crystal projectors (MCPs) store liquid, energized crystals by heavily compressing them within a specialized container. When released, the molten crystal will begin to rapidly cool and lose capacity. At a certain point the crystal will lose capacity faster than it can passively discharge magic, causing it to violently explode."
  support_weapons_g:0 "General-Purpose Machine Guns"
    support_weapons_g_desc:0 "General-purpose machine guns (GPMGs) complement HMGs in that they are lighter and can be more easily carried by troops into combat, allowing time for HMGs to move up. They feature similar design and construction, such as air cooling and replacable barrels, and can be adapted for belt-fed ammunition or magazines."
  support_weapons_h:0 "Crystal Pulse Lasers"
    support_weapons_h_desc:0 "A derivative of the Spellray cannon concept, crystal pulse lasers (CPLs) project thin beams of magic that are rapidly oscillated on and off. This maintains the effectiveness of Spellrays while conserving the limited power of infantry-carried crystal batteries, allowing for a weapon capable of melting through anything with sufficient time."

  electronic_countermeasures_large:0 "Electronic Countermeasure System"
    electronic_countermeasures_large_desc:0 "An electronic warfare system designed to disrupt air-to-air and ground-to-air RADAR systems or other detection systems such as infrared and lasers. It can be used offensively by jamming enemy communications and detection, or defensively by manipulating our RADAR signature and disrupting guided missiles."
  decoy_flare_small:0 "Light Chaff Launcher"
    decoy_flare_small_desc:0 "A RADAR countermeasure that disperses a cloud of metal strips to blind and disrupt RADAR and guidance systems. It has proven effective at disrupting guided air-to-air and ground-to-air missiles, and will improve the survivability of our pilots."
  decoy_flare_medium:0 "Medium Chaff Launcher"

    advanced_aircraft_construction_desc:0 "We can apply advanced fuselage designs to newer jet aircraft such as variable sweep wings and diverterless supersonic inlets to maximize their performance at various speeds. However, this will lead to an increase in costs due to the materials and marepower needed to facilitate more advanced designs."

  general_purpose_bombs:0 "General-Purpose Bombs"
    general_purpose_bombs_desc:0 "General-purpose bombs (GPBs) are a modern compromise in traditional, specialized bomb design. Instead of focusing on blast damage, penetration, or fragmentation, GPBs have a standardized payload that balances out all three factors. Instead, the bombs themselves can be modified by swapping out fuzes and fins to specialize GPBs for roles such as ground attack, bunker-busting, and foliage clearing."

  ## AIRSHIPS / MOTHERSHIPS ##
  airship_airframes:0 "999 Airship Airframes"
    airship_airframes_desc:0 "Popularized during the Storm King's conquest of Zebrica, airships are large aircraft that utilize heavier-than-air floatation to carry munitions at high altitude for long distances. Their massive size, low speed, and vulnerability to incendiary ammunition make them easy targets for opponents with interceptors or sufficient anti-air. Although outdated by modern standards, they perform well against opponents that lack the industry to produce aircraft or anti-air."

  AIR_TITLE_MOTHERSHIP: "Heavy Airship"
    AIR_TITLE_MOTHERSHIP_DESC: "Heavy Airships are full-metal derivatives of the fragile airships seen during the Storm King's campaign. They're kept afloat by a complex system of automatic telekinetic-spell casters. The added lift allows it to carry naval-caliber batteries and aircraft wings."

  mothership:0 "Heavy Airship"
  reinforced_wings_mothership:0 "Angled Armour Belts"
    reinforced_wings_mothership_desc:0 "While traditional naval armour layouts focus the armour to the sides and top, airship armour must deviate from this doctrine. The biggest threats to airships are heavy ground batteries and dive bombers, meaning we can improve the effectiveness of airship armour by angling it to increase armour thickness when attacking from above or below."
  miniature_fighters:0 "Dedicated Aerial Batteries"
    miniature_fighters_desc:0 "Previous gun batteries were directly taken from existing naval designs. Newer models designed specifically for use on heavy airships are lighter, allowing us to mount them on the bottom of the hull. This increases the firing angles available to our airships, preventing aircraft from exploiting the weak underbelly of our airships whilst also allowing airships to provide better ground support through direct bombardment."
  aerial_hangars:0 "Telekinetic Efficiency"
    aerial_hangars_desc:0 "New refinements to the automated Heavier-than-air-telekinetic casting systems reduce the number of spells active at once whilst increasing their duration. This increases the overall efficiency of the system, cutting down on crystal fuel use and improving the overall handling of our airships."
