  # Infantry Anti-air/Anti-Tank
  ## Anti-tank
  infantry_anti_tank:0 "Infantry Anti-Tank"
  infantry_anti_tank_0:0 "1009 Anti-Tank Rifle"
    infantry_anti_tank_0_desc:0 "The advent of armored vehicles such as tanks would start the development of a new class of infantry-carried weapons capable of disabling these vehicles. One of the first designs proposed was an upsized rifle capable of firing high-caliber rounds that could penetrate armor plates."
    INFANTRY_AT_TOOLTIP:0 "\n£unit_infantry_icon_small All Infantry will require an additional §Y8§! §Y$infantry_anti_tank$.§!"
  infantry_anti_tank_1:0 "1013 Rocket Launcher"
    infantry_anti_tank_1_desc:0 "Anti-tank grenades have proven their worth in combat, although they lacked effectiveness beyond close ranges that exposed our infantry to danger. We can mitigate this weakness by firing specialized rocket-propelled grenades from dedicated infantry-carried launchers. This allows our infantry to attack armored targets from engagement distances previously reserved to towed anti-tank guns and other tanks."
  infantry_anti_tank_2:0 "1019 Rocket Launcher"
    infantry_anti_tank_2_desc:0 "Improvements in rocket design design have allowed us to specialize them into dedicated armor-piercing and high-explosive ammunition. This gives our troops greater flexibility in engagements as the rocket launcher can be used to engage both hard and soft targets."
  infantry_anti_tank_3:0 "1025 Rocket Launcher"
    infantry_anti_tank_3_desc:0 "Newer rocket launchers not only see use as anti-tank weapons, but are able to use specialized munitions to attack and destroy bunkers or other fortifications."
  ## Anti-air
  infantry_anti_air:0 "Infantry Anti-Air"
  infantry_anti_air_0:0 "1026 Creature-Portable Air Defense System"
    infantry_anti_air_0_short:0 "1026 CREPADS"
    infantry_anti_air_0_desc:0 "A specialized missile launcher that is capable of locking onto aircraft and firing a heat-seeking missile to neutralize it.

    infantry_at2_upgrade_2_desc:0 "Introducing specialized ammunition variants for specific purposes, such as anti-personnel or anti-tank, will improve our rocket launcher teams' efficiency in dealing with those threats as opposed to using a single type of rocket for either one."
  infantry_at_a_upgrade_1:0 "Delayed Rocket Activation"
    infantry_at_a_upgrade_1_desc:0 "To reduce backblast, we can introduce a delayed-rocket-motor activation system to our rocket launchers. This involves propelling the rocket with a much smaller explosive charge, then activating the rocket motor of the projectile once it has reached a safe distance from the operator. The initial charge produces much less backblast, allowing the weapon to be fired in smaller spaces."
  infantry_at_a_upgrade_2:0 "Advanced Fuzes"
    infantry_at_a_upgrade_2_desc:0 "The introduction of spaced armor has severely degraded the performance of our rocket launchers. We can circumvent these new systems by designing ammunition with smarter fuzes capable of differentiating thinner spaced armor from the tank's main armor."
  infantry_at_b_upgrade_1:0 "Disposable Rocket Launchers"
    infantry_at_b_upgrade_1_desc:0 "Newer models of rocket launchers forgo reloadability in favor of easier production and portability. These disposable rocket launchers are treated as ammunition similar to grenades rather than full weapon systems, and are meant to complement the latter rather than fully replacing them."
  infantry_at_b_upgrade_2:0 "Magic Sights"
    infantry_at_b_upgrade_2_desc:0 "Special gun sights that utilize small magic crystals to launch an invisible projectile a pre-determined distance and pull the projectile back. Armor thickness of tanks can be determined by measuring the density of the projectile after it returns, allowing gunners to engage the weakest parts of enemy armor."
  infantry_aa_upgrade_1:0 "New Missile Trackers"
    infantry_aa_upgrade_1_desc:0 "Dual-detector seekers utilizing both infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) tracking allows our homing missiles to distinguish aircraft from their countermeasures and improves homing capability when the aircraft's exhaust is not in sight."
  infantry_aa_upgrade_2:0 "IFF Integration"
    infantry_aa_upgrade_2_desc:0 "Built-in extendable antennas on CREPADS allow them to send out interrogator signals to identify nearby aircraft. This will reduce chances of friendly-fire on allied aircraft."

  magic_tank_weapon_nsb0:0 "Heavy Magic Weaponry I"
    magic_tank_weapon_nsb0_desc:0 "Although similar in theory to magical small arms, heavy magic weapons require a higher magnitude of magic to operate which introduces a multitude of problems. Initial prototypes utilize modified tank or artillery shells to charge a magic cannon, however the cannon-to-shell interface degrades rapidly from continued use due to high amounts of magic being transferred in a short period of time."
  magic_tank_weapon_nsb1:0 "Heavy Magic Weaponry II"
    magic_tank_weapon_nsb1_desc:0 "Using crystal-infused metals, we can reduce degradation within the magic cannon interface. This increases costs but is essential in reducing deterioration of the cannon. We can also improve the effectiveness of our heavy magic weapons by refining the spells being cast such as reducing the overall size of spellrays to focus the projectile into a smaller point and so on."
  magic_tank_weapon_nsb2:0 "Heavy Magic Weaponry III"
    magic_tank_weapon_nsb2_desc:0 "A new method of magic charging utilizes a large vat of liquid crystal to store magical energy. When needed, crystal is pumped from the vat through the magic cannon interface where it can be rapidly charged. This allows tank crews to adjust the strength of their shots as well, due to the unique charging method. However, carrying a large vat of liquid crystal leaves the tank vulnerable if it lacks armor."
  magic_tank_weapon_nsb3:0 "Heavy Magic Weaponry IV"
    magic_tank_weapon_nsb3_desc:0 "Further refinement of the liquid-crystal-charging method has led to reductions in volume through fluid substitutes that increase the density of liquid crystals, shrinking the size of the storage vat which in turn minimizes overall vulnerability. These substitutes also speed up magic charging by allowing crystals to discharge faster when within the magic cannon interface."

    ifv_equipment_0_short:0 "1030 IFV"
    ifv_equipment_0_desc:0 "Although APCs were versatile, it was not possible to mount heavier weaponry on them without sacrificing crew capacity. Newer designs, called infantry fighting vehicles, carry less infantry but mount heavier weaponry. IFVs are not complete replacements for APCs, and are meant to assist them in supporting dismounted infantry."
    APC_IFV_TOOLTIP:0 "\n£unit_mechanized_icon_small Mechanized Brigades will require an additional §Y20§! §Y$ifv_equipment$.§!"
  ## Amphibious Mechanized
  ## Armoured Cars
  armored_car8:0 "Early IFV Prototypes"
