# EQUESTRIA AT WAR: NEW TECHNOLOGY

Please do not post this on the steam workshop.
Feel free to use anything I made here in your own mods. Please see the CREDITS file for information on files/images/audio that I did not make.

The EAW tech tree has always been a bit messy, and this issue has been compounded due to the increasing number of new technologies added through DLCs. Originally, this mod was part of a bigger narrative submod that I'm making, but I decided to split it off before it was too late.

This submod for Equestria at War:
- Decompresses all tech trees (all trees should have technologies reach 1030 at minimum)
- Adds new technologies
- Organizes the tech trees
- Organizes the technology files
- Generally improves visual clarity and look of tech trees & folders
- etc. etc. etc.

Planned:
- Adjusting country history files to start with certain technologies (uniforms mainly)
- Organizing the racial tech trees
- Taking a look at country equipment sprites
