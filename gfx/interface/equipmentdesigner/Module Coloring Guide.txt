I used Photoshop 2023 with a DDS plugin to automate a colorized hue shift:

DDS Plugin: https://developer.nvidia.com/texture-tools-exporter

Steps:
1. Open module DDS image in Photoshop.

2. Load Transparency as Alpha channel.

3. [Top-bar] Image -> Adjustments -> Hue/Saturation
	A new window should pop up with Hue/Saturation options.

4. Toggle 'Colorize' checkbox in bottom right.

5.1 For Aircraft Modules (Red):
	Hue = +360 (or all the way to the right)
	Saturation = +50
	Lightness = 0

5.2 For Tank Modules (Green):
	Hue = +125
	Saturation = +25
	Lightness = 0

5.3 Naval Modules are unchanged (still Blue)

5.4 If an icon seems a bit dark after changing its color, increase its Brightness by 25 and its Contrast by 20.

6. Click OK to apply the Hue/Saturation change.

7. [Top-bar] File -> Save
	A new window should pop up with save options.

8. Save Options:
	Format: 8.8.8.8 BGRA 32 bpp | unsigned
	Texture Type: 2D Texture (Note: this may not show up, don't worry .)
	Image Type: Color Map
	...
	Generate Mipmaps: YES
	... Don't touch anything else.

9. Click Save to save.

10. DONE!
